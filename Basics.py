# We are getting the encodings, and then we are comparing the encodings with the test image
# 128 measurements of both the faces
# Linear SVM to find out whether the images match or not

# To do that we will find the distance
faceDis = face_recognition.face_distance([encodeElon], encodeTest)
# The lower the distance the better the match is
# So printing the distance
print(results, faceDis)
# We compare if they both are the same images or not
#  There's a clear difference when their faces match and don't match

# So the final step we can do here is just to display this on the final result image
